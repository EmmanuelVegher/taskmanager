BUILD FAILED in 1m 17s
Error: Gradle task assembleDebug failed with exit code 1

Solution:
This error message indicates that your Android project is missing a namespace declaration in one of its build.gradle files, specifically in the flutter_native_timezone plugin module. This is a common issue that arises when using newer versions of the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP).

Here's how to fix this:

Steps to Resolve the "Namespace not specified" Error:

Locate the build.gradle file for flutter_native_timezone plugin:

Navigate to your Flutter project's root directory in your file explorer or terminal.

Go into the android folder.

Then go into the flutter_native_timezone folder.

Inside this folder, you should find a build.gradle file (or potentially build.gradle.kts if you are using Kotlin DSL for Gradle).

The path will look something like this: your_project_root/android/flutter_native_timezone/build.gradle

Open the build.gradle file in a text editor or your IDE (like Android Studio or VS Code).

Add the namespace property:
Inside the android block of your build.gradle file, you need to add a namespace property. The namespace should be the package name of the flutter_native_timezone plugin. You can usually find a hint for the correct namespace in the error message itself, or you can often use the plugin's package name as a reasonable guess.

Add the following line inside the android { ... } block in your build.gradle file:

android {
// ... other configurations ...

    namespace "com.whelksoft.flutter_native_timezone" // Add this line
}
Use code with caution.
Groovy
Important:

Replace "com.whelksoft.flutter_native_timezone" with the correct namespace if it's different. While com.whelksoft.flutter_native_timezone is the likely namespace for the flutter_native_timezone plugin, double-check if the error message or plugin documentation gives a specific namespace. If you're unsure, try this namespace first, as it's the most common one for this plugin.

If you are using build.gradle.kts (Kotlin DSL), the syntax is slightly different:

android {
// ... other configurations ...

    namespace = "com.whelksoft.flutter_native_timezone" // Add this line
}
Use code with caution.
Kotlin
Save the build.gradle file.

Sync Gradle in your Flutter project:

In Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA: You should see a "Sync Now" link in the top right corner of the editor after you modify the build.gradle file. Click "Sync Now".

In VS Code or other editors: Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and type "Flutter: Clean Project". Then type "Flutter: Get Packages". This will trigger a Gradle sync.

Clean and Rebuild your Flutter project:

In Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA: Go to "Build" > "Clean Project" and then "Build" > "Rebuild Project".

In VS Code or other editors: Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and type "Flutter: Clean Project". Then run your app again (e.g., flutter run).

Run your Flutter app again: Try launching your app using flutter run or by running it from your IDE.

Why is this happening?

Newer versions of the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) require you to explicitly declare a namespace for each module in your Android project. Plugins like flutter_native_timezone might not have been updated yet to automatically include this namespace in their default configuration. By adding the namespace line in the build.gradle file of the plugin, you are providing the necessary information for the AGP to build your Android project correctly.


Error 2:

Error: Gradle task assembleDebug failed with exit code 1


Solution:
The Android Gradle plugin supports only Kotlin Gradle plugin version 1.5.20 and higher.
The following dependencies do not satisfy the required version:
project ':flutter_native_timezone' -> org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:1.3.50
Use code with caution.
This means the flutter_native_timezone plugin is using an old version of the Kotlin Gradle plugin (1.3.50), which is incompatible with the Android Gradle Plugin version your project is using.

To fix this, you need to update the Kotlin Gradle plugin version in the flutter_native_timezone's build.gradle file.

Here's how to do it:

Open the build.gradle file for flutter_native_timezone again:

Navigate to your_project_root/android/flutter_native_timezone/build.gradle

Locate the kotlin_version variable:
Inside the buildscript block, you will find:

buildscript {
ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.50' // This is the line you need to change
// ... rest of the buildscript block ...
}
Use code with caution.
Groovy
Update kotlin_version:
Change the kotlin_version to a version that is 1.5.20 or higher. A good choice would be to use a recent stable version like 1.7.10 or even the latest stable Kotlin version available. Let's use 1.7.10 for now.

Modify the line to:

buildscript {
ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10' // Updated Kotlin version
// ... rest of the buildscript block ...
}
Use code with caution.
Groovy
Here is the complete modified build.gradle file:

group 'com.whelksoft.flutter_native_timezone'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

buildscript {
ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10' // Updated Kotlin version here
repositories {
google()
mavenCentral()
}

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.2.1' // Keep your AGP version (4.2.1)
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}

rootProject.allprojects {
repositories {
google()
mavenCentral()
}
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.library'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'

android {
namespace "com.whelksoft.flutter_native_timezone" // Make sure namespace is still here

    compileSdkVersion 30

    sourceSets {
        main.java.srcDirs += 'src/main/kotlin'
    }
    defaultConfig {
        targetSdkVersion 30
        minSdkVersion 16
        testInstrumentationRunner "android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
    }
    lintOptions {
        disable 'InvalidPackage'
    }
}

dependencies {
implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:$kotlin_version"
}

java {
sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
